1. first make your file sturcture like this

project/
|-- src/
|   `-- org/
|       `-- aundip/
|           `-- test/
|               `-- JarExample.java
|-- manifest.txt
`-- bin/ [here we will keep our class file after compilation]

2. go inside test folder, create JarExample.java file and paste this code:
package org.anudip.test;

/**creating class named JarExample to print â€œSuccessfully executed Jar
on successful compilation and run.
*/

public class JarExample{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Successfully executed Jar");
	}
}

2. now then open cmd at this location (inside test folder)
   and type command: javac JarExample.java
   this will produce a JarExample.class file cut and paste that inside bin.

3. create manifest.txt file inside project folder if not already then paste:
Main-Class: org.anudip.test.JarExample
[leave a newline at end in manifest file]

4. now run this cmd to make jar file of JarExample.class file inside bin and
   including the manifest inside it.
   command: jar -cfvm JarExample.jar manifest.txt -C bin . [include this dot at end]

5. now as you have created the jar file then let's run it .
   command: java -jar JarExample.jar
   output: Successfully executed Jar
